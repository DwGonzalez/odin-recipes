    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously
        cheesy
        filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a
        blend of
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
        crusty
        garlic bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork, 1/2 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the
            oven-ready variety
            to save time.</li>
        <li>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer
            together).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a
        brief
        overview of what you can expect:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Cook the meat:</b> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and
                continue cooking until
                it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons
                of salt,
                oregano, and sugar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.
        </li>
        <li><b>Make the cheese layer:</b> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the
            remaining salt,
            and pepper
            in a bowl.</li>
        <li><b>Assemble the lasagna:</b> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending
            with
            mozzarella)
            until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
        <li><b>Bake the lasagna:</b> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the
            foil and
            continue
            baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
